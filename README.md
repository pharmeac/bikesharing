## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to visually present bikesharing data from New York City to a potential invester, with the purpose of establishing a similiar venture in DesMoines, Iowa.

## Results
### Data at a Glance
We start out with a visualization showing the number of rides evaluated for this project, and the breakdown of the riders by gender and usertype.

### Top Locations
This visualization illustrates the top starting and top ending locations for the bikeshares. As you can see the top starting locations are very similiar to the top ending locations. This visualization gives us insight into the most popular places for users to have access to the bikesharing service.

### Checkout Times for Users
This visualization shows the time duration of the bike sharing rides. As you can see, nearly all rides are less than an hour, with most being less than 20 minutes.

### Checkout Times by Gender
This visualization shows us the checkout times for the bikesharing rides by gender. As you can see, a similiar trend for ride length exists for both males and females.

### Trips by Weekday
This visualization shows time and weekday distribution of the bikesharing rides. There is a trend for Monday through Friday rides to have peaks in the morning and evening commute hours. The ride distribution for the weekends is more evenly distributed throughout the day.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
This visualization is similiar to the previous except that we have added in gender to determine if males and females have different times and days they are most likely to employ the service. Both males and females have the same trends in this area.

### User Trips by Gender
In this visualization we illustrate the pattern of bike shares by gender, weekday, and by the user type. This illustration shows that the service is heavily dependent on male subscribers.

## Summary
The analysis shows this service is highly utilized in New York City, with over 2 million rides in one month alone. The NYC service is primarilty used by males that are subscribers to the service (vs. ad hoc customers). During the work week, the highest utilized times are morning and evening commute hours. However, on the weekends, the rides are more evenly distributed throughout the day. To dive deeper into this data, I would suggest adding in a map layer for mass transit routes to determine if the proximity to mass transit impacts the use of the service. Additionally, we could also analyze the most popular bike IDs used so that bike maintenance efforts can be focused to the bikes that are utilized the most.
